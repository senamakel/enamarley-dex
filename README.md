BitwordsDEX - Decentralized Exchange for BITW
==================================================

BitwordsDEX is a fork of OasisDEX by MakerDAO. It allows you to trade BITW tokens with ETH.

This is a simple on-chain OTC market for ERC20 Standard Tokens on the Ethereum Blockchain. You can either pick an order from the order book (in which case delivery will happen instantly), or submit a new order yourself.

**MaharajaDEX is undergoing alpha testing: Proceed at your own risk, and use only small amounts of ETH and MKR.**
